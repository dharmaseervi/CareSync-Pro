Specialists at our clinic have extensive experience diagnosing and treating adolescent girls with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). Our endocrinologists, nutritionists, and psychologists work together to provide patients with personalized care.\n                Early detection and treatment can help to reduce symptoms such as irregular menstrual cycles and excessive facial and body hair. It can also help prevent adult complications like infertility and type 2 diabetes. Adult polycystic ovary syndrome is also diagnosed and managed here.\n                Losing weight may be the most effective way to reduce the risk of adult complications. It is especially effective when combined with medications that suppress androgen production and regulate menstrual cycles. \n                Follow-up visits every three months can help ensure that you are on track to meet your weight loss and fitness objectives. Our doctors may repeat blood tests to measure insulin and androgen levels during these appointments. \n                `\n            }\n        },\n        {\n            image: img8,\n            title: \"Intrauterine Insemination (IUI)\",\n            subTitle: 'Make the miracle happen',\n            detail_page: {\n                image: dimg8,\n                details: `We use intrauterine insemination (IUI) because this method of injecting concentrated sperm directly into the uterus has a higher pregnancy success rate than other methods of artificial insemination. When you choose, you can be confident that we will investigate the cause of your infertility before beginning any treatment. We may also suggest other more appropriate options that may assist you in becoming pregnant.\n                Using the intrauterine insemination (IUI) treatment technique, our team has achieved incredible success rates. Through our advanced IUI treatments, our fertility specialists have assisted thousands of couples in realizing their dreams of becoming parents.\n                The risks of intrauterine insemination (IUI) are extremely low. However, during an IUI cycle, fertility medications may stimulate the ovaries to produce more than one egg. If both eggs are fertilized, multiple births are possible. IUI may also cause hot flashes, mood swings, headaches, and nausea.`\n            }\n        },\n\n    ]\n\n    return (\n        <>\n            <div className='d-flex flex-wrap
