Through our advanced IUI treatments, our fertility specialists have assisted thousands of couples in realizing their dreams of becoming parents.\n            The risks of intrauterine insemination (IUI) are extremely low. However, during an IUI cycle, fertility medications may stimulate the ovaries to produce more than one egg. If both eggs are fertilized, multiple births are possible. IUI may also cause hot flashes, mood swings, headaches, and nausea.`\n        }\n    },\n    {\n        image: img9,\n        title: \"Adolescent Health\",\n        subTitle: 'Make your teenage years care free',\n        detail_page: {\n            image: dimg9,\n            details: `Adolescent gynecological problems are fairly common, and they can have physical and psychological consequences for young women and teenagers. \n            Vaginal disorders, vulval injury, menstrual problems, sexual development disorders, abnormal skin changes, and abnormal vaginal discharge are all common adolescent gynecological issues.
