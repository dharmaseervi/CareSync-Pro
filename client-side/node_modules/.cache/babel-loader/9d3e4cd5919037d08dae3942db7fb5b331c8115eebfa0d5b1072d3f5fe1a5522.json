Vaginal delivery and natural childbirth are other terms for normal delivery. It is a type of childbirth in which the mother gives birth naturally, with little or no medical or surgical intervention.\n            To endure and control pain, pregnant women who choose to deliver naturally rely on a variety of evidence-based breathing and relaxation techniques. Choosing a natural delivery method can be excruciating. Extreme exhaustion, feeling cold or shaky, soreness, uterine cramping, and a sense of accomplishment are all possible side effects. Throughout the various stages of labor and childbirth, our care team provides complete guidance and support.\n            `\n        }\n    },\n    {\n        image: img11,\n        title: \"Health Check-up\",\n        subTitle: 'Stay a step ahead',\n        detail_page: {\n            image: dimg11,\n            details: `We provide a comprehensive screening of women's primary, menstrual, sexual, and behavioral health in order to prevent diseases or detect them early enough to treat them effectively. \n            Our preventive care services are designed to provide comprehensive screening, which includes a routine gynecological examination, vaccinations, pap smear, and pelvic exam.

In comparison to open surgery, a laparoscopy requires a smaller incision in the abdomen. It also takes less time to recover than the latter.\n            A laparoscope is inserted into the body through this small incision. This sleek and illuminated device is used to figure out the main problematic cause. Endometriosis, fibroids, ovarian cysts, pelvic inflammatory disease, pelvic adhesions, reproductive cancers, infertility, and other conditions can affect women.`\n        }\n    },\n    {\n        image: img13,\n        title: \"Vaccination And Check-up\",\n        subTitle: 'Trap the root cause',\n        detail_page: {\n            image: dimg13,\n            details: `Regular health checks can detect any early warning signs of illness.
